# Blog Protocol Based on Nostr

- [CIP-01: Basic protocol flow description](cips/01.md)
- [CIP-02: Notify message](cips/02.md)

Flycat is a blog protocol based on [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) to gather all your creation and artworks into one single persona site using one single protocol, weather they are your blog articles, your photographies or drawings.

Right now we are building [flycat-web](https://github.com/digi-monkey/flycat-web), a chinese nostr web client to impl flycat-protocol.

Ideally, we plan to build an demo, which is pure frontend project without any database/backend, to showcase flycat protocol. Because it is based on Nostr protocol, we can also leverage the existing Nostr protocol to intergrate the tweet-like short messages and an E2E chatting window talking to blog owner into the demo.
