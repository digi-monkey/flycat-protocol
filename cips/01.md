# CIP-01

This CIP defines the basic protocol that should be implemented by everybody. New CIPs may add new optional (or mandatory) fields and messages and features to the structures and flows described here.

`draft` `mandatory` `author:digi-monkey`

## Short description

The purpose of flycat protocol is to leverage the [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) to build persona site experiences, which can be considered to be an extension of Nostr.

Most data used in blog site needs to be updatable(eg, a blog post). So all the data structures used in flycat are based on Replaceable Events on [NIP-16](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/16.md).

To Nostr, flycat data is just an event object with:

- a kind 10000 <= n < 20000
- tags contains flycat header

```sh
{
  "id": <32-bytes sha256 of the the serialized event data>
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": <integer, always between 10000 and 20000>,
  "tags": [
    ["flycat", <version, optional, can be empty>, <flycat dataType in hexStr, always "01">, <flycat flag in hexStr, eg:"01", "02">],
    ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
  ],
  "content": <flycat schema serialized string>,
  "sig": <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>
}
```

Two things notable here:

1. Every flycat event MUST include flycat header in the tags

flycat header include 4 parts:

`flycat` | `<version, optional>` | `<dataType number, u8, 1 byte>` |`<flag number, u8, 1 byte>` |

### Basic DataType

| DataType  | Type    | Description                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 01        | storage | keep stored in Nostr, might be update later   |
| 02        | memory  | can be deleted after some time                |

### Basic Flags

| Flag  | Description                                         |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 01    | site metadata, contains site content-ids            |
| 02    | article page, a list of articles                    |
| 03    | photo page, a list of photo url                     |

2. We define the different flycat schema in the `content` field on the Replaceable Event object.

Every schema is a kind of media content on the persona site, like a blog, a photo, etc. They are all created by the owner, so flycat can just gather them on your site in just one single protocol.

#### 01: Site Metadata

- event kind must be `10000`
- event tags: ["flycat", <version, optional, can be empty>, "01", "01"],
- content schema:
  | Field           | Value Description                | Datatype               | Size(bytes) |
  |-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
  | site-name       | name of the site                 | string                 | 32          |
  | site-description| description of the site          | string                 | 420         |
  | content-ids     | a list of content-id number      | [u16;256]              | 2560 max    |
  | extra data      | -                                |  -                     | -           |

`content-id` is a number with such format: `<Flag, 1 byte>` | `<offset, 1 byte, number range(0, 256] >`

content-id is used to locate the data store. eg, `0213` means the flycat data stored at the event with kind `10013` is a article page.

#### 02: Article Page

Article page is a special content that combines a list of article post. the combination does not require any logic, client can impl its own way to leverage the pages to improve data loading/updating performance. For example, the newer the article post is, the higher possibility to update this article will be. so you can put the newer article into single page with very few items to speed up the content updating. After a certain time, an article is less likely to be re-edit and updating again by his author, therefore it can be stored into a archive-like page. Client can also make a hot-data article page that has been viewed most.

- event kind must between `10001` and `10256`
- event tags: ["flycat", <version, optional, can be empty>, "01", "02"],
- content schema:
  | Field           | Value Description                | Datatype               | Size(bytes) |
  |-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
  | count           | how many article in this page    | u8                     | 1           |
  | article-ids     | a list of unique article id      | [u32;count]            | 1024 max    |
  | data            | a list of article data           | [u16;256]              | 2560 max    |
  
  article data schema:
  | Field           | Value Description                | Datatype               | Size(bytes) |
  |-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
  | title           | article title                    | string                 | 24          |
  | content-size    | article content size             | u32                    | 4           |
  | content         | article content                  | [u8;content-size]      | -           |
  | created-at      | created unix timestamp number    | u64                    | 8           |
  | updated-at      | update  unix timestamp number    | u64                    | 8           |
