This CIP defines the basic protocol that should be implemented by everybody. New CIPs may add new optional (or mandatory) fields and messages and features to the structures and flows described here.

## Notify Message

Use event kind 1 defined in [NIP-1](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md#basic-event-kinds) as a notification message when new content publishing on the blog.

When new content is appended to Article Page, the client should also post another event to Nostr relayer with the following requirement:

```sh
{
  "id": <32-bytes sha256 of the the serialized event data>
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": <integer, always 1>,
  "tags": [
    ["flycat", <version, optional, can be empty>, <flycat dataType in hexStr, always "02">, <article-id, eg "e72a32b4">, <article-page-id, eg "02255">],
    ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
  ],
  "content": <short notify message, eg "my blog has post a new article ${article title}, check this link..">,
  "sig": <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>
}
```

Other clients will then subscribe to this notification message to check if there is new content.
